# Keelson rib documentation style guide

This guide governs the documentation site under `docs/` for this rib. It
**extends** the keelson harness style guide rather than forking it: where this
file is silent, keelson's
[STYLE.md](https://github.com/danielscholl/keelson/blob/main/docs/STYLE.md) is
the parent law. Read both before writing or generating a page.

A rib's docs are a family member of the keelson docs, not a separate brand. A
reader moving from the harness site to a rib site should feel the same hand:
the same blueprint identity, the same tiers, the same voice. Only the subject
changes. keelson's STYLE.md states that the harness "does not document specific
ribs ... Document only the generic, reusable rib contract." This site fills that
gap from the other side: it documents the one concrete rib that implements the
contract.

This file is the per-rib instance of a shared pattern. A new rib copies it,
keeps the rules verbatim, and swaps only the rib-specific specifics (the tier
content, the snapshot keys, the screenshots, the upstreams credited). See
"Starting a new rib's docs" at the foot.

## What a rib inherits verbatim

These are copied from keelson and held identical. Do not diverge; a divergence
here is a bug, not a style choice.

| Inherited | Rule |
|---|---|
| Theme | `src/styles/keelson-theme.css` is a byte-identical copy of keelson's. The blueprint palette (navy `--keel`, brass accent) is the single source of color. Do not fork it per page. |
| Framework + versions | Astro Starlight, dependency versions pinned to keelson's (`@astrojs/starlight`, `astro`, `starlight-llms-txt`). Bump in lockstep with the harness site. |
| IA tiers | The same five: `concepts`, `guides`, `tutorials`, `reference`, `design`. No new top-level tiers. |
| `llms.txt` | `starlight-llms-txt` emits `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/llms-small.txt` at build. |
| CI | `docs.yml` builds on `docs/**` push and PR (validation) and deploys from `main`. The Bun version is pinned to the same release `ci.yml` validates against. |
| Tooling fences | `biome.json` ignores `docs` (the Astro project is checked by `astro check`, not biome). `.gitignore` ignores `.astro/`. |

Naming conventions that keep the family legible:

- Site title is `Keelson Rib · <Name>` (for example `Keelson Rib · WorkIQ`).
- Pages deploy to the project Pages URL: `site: https://<owner>.github.io`,
  `base: /<repo>` (for example `/keelson-rib-workiq`), `trailingSlash: always`.
- Favicon is the shared `keelson-mark.svg`.

## Where a rib differs from the harness

A rib has no bespoke marketing landing, so the layout is deliberately simpler
than keelson's. These divergences are intentional and load-bearing:

- **Flat content layout.** Pages live at `src/content/docs/<tier>/`, not
  keelson's nested `src/content/docs/docs/<tier>/`. keelson nests because it
  serves a hand-authored landing at `/` and pushes docs under `/docs/`. A rib
  has no separate landing, so Starlight owns `/` and a flat tree is cleaner.
- **Sidebar Overview links `/`** (keelson links `/docs/`).
- **No bespoke drafting-sheet landing.** There is no `public/index.html` +
  `keelson.css`. Starlight's overview index (`src/content/docs/index.mdx`) is
  the root. If a rib later earns a hand-authored landing, it adopts keelson's
  drafting-sheet treatment rather than inventing a new one.

## What each tier holds, for a rib

Same tiers as keelson, aimed at the concrete rib. The WorkIQ rib's framing:

- **`concepts/`** — the shape of the rib: the boot handshake to discovery to
  schema conversion to registration pipeline, and the keelson base it attaches
  to. Explain *why* the rib is built this way before *how*. Link out to
  keelson's concept pages for anything generic (the rib contract, tools); do
  not re-explain the harness.
- **`guides/`** — task-oriented operator how-tos: install the rib, sign in to
  WorkIQ, link it into a local keelson checkout for development.
- **`tutorials/`** — a problem-first learning rail, each page handing off to the
  next. The capstone is the rib's second job made explicit: build your own
  tools-only rib from zero, with this rib as the worked example.
- **`reference/`** — the contract tier for *this* rib: the bridged tool set,
  the intent flags, and every environment variable the rib reads. Terse and
  precise, like keelson's reference pages.
- **`design/`** — decision records and the keelson base gaps the rib was built
  against. The right home for design narrative the source comment policy keeps
  out of code.

## Voice

Inherit keelson's voice wholesale: engineering-honest, practitioner to
practitioner, active voice, short sentences, no marketing register, no
unshipped-capability claims, no "Generated with" footers. Two rib-specific notes:

- **Seat the harness relationship once, then drop it.** State "X as a keelson
  rib" at the entry point and move on. Do not keep re-explaining what a rib is;
  link to keelson's concept tier for the generic model and spend your words on
  what *this* rib does.
- **Em dashes: know the boundary.** Docs-site prose (everything under
  `src/content/docs/`) follows keelson's no-em-dash rule: use a comma, a colon,
  parentheses, or two sentences. The repo `README.md` and source files follow
  the repo's own house style, which uses em dashes; that is not a docs-site page
  and the rule does not reach it.

## Figures

Inherit keelson's figure discipline: no ASCII-art diagrams, every figure gets a
one-sentence lead-in in the prose above it and a numbered `figcaption`
("Figure 1. ..."), never dropped in cold.

A rib's signature figures are usually **app screenshots** of its live surfaces,
not abstract diagrams. This rib is tools-only today, so it has no surface to
screenshot yet; when the roadmap lands one, commit the render under `docs/` and
surface it as a captioned figure rather than re-describing it in prose. keelson
reserves the dark `screenshot-figure` frame for app screenshots and the light
`diagram-figure` frame for diagrams; the inherited theme styles both.

There is **no `Figure` component to author.** Figures are native Markdown
`<figure>` / `<figcaption>`, styled by the inherited `keelson-theme.css`. Write
them directly; the frame and caption styling come for free.

## Attribution is part of the docs pattern

A rib that shells or ports upstream tooling carries the same attribution
contract keelson does, so credit travels with the package:

- **`LICENSE`** — the rib's own license text (the file must exist, not just a
  `package.json` field).
- **`NOTICE`** — per-upstream attribution following keelson's NOTICE structure:
  a header, then one section per upstream with `Project` / `Source` / `License`.
  Quote an upstream's full license text verbatim only when it differs from the
  rib's own license; when it matches, the name and link suffice.
- **`README.md` Acknowledgments** — a short section linking each upstream and
  pointing at `NOTICE`, with the License section pointing at `LICENSE`.
- Ship `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` in `package.json` `files`.

## Definition of done (every rib docs page)

A rib page inherits keelson's per-page checklist (figures captioned, prose
within the ~72ch measure, no em dashes in docs prose, sentence case, the
metaphor seated once and then dropped, a `related` cross-link block). Plus one
rib-specific item:

- **Link back to the harness** wherever a concept is generic. The rib documents
  what it adds; the keelson docs own the contract it adds against. A page that
  re-explains the harness has drifted out of scope.

## Starting a new rib's docs

To stand up docs for another rib, copy this rib's `docs/` Astro project and this
`STYLE.md`, then:

1. Set the site `title`, `base`, and `description` to the new rib (keep the
   `Keelson Rib · <Name>` title shape).
2. Keep `keelson-theme.css`, the tier folders, the `llms.txt` plugin, `docs.yml`,
   and the biome/gitignore fences as-is.
3. Replace the tier content with the new rib's framing; keep this file's rules
   verbatim and update only the rib-specific examples (snapshot keys,
   screenshots, upstreams credited).
